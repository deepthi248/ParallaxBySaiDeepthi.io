            <span class="subtitle">The Thrilling side</span>
        </h1>
        <p>The Maldives is 99% water and just one percent land. And as one might expect, the thrills of the Maldives lie
            on, under or over the surface of the water. Wherever you choose to holiday in the Maldives, there is
            watersports on offer. But be mindful that some resorts prefer to offer their guests complete tranquility
            without the sound of motorized engines that propel many a ride on the water. But even those resorts would
            offer relaxing canoe rides, wind surfing, snorkeling and diving.</p>

        <h1>Andaman and Nicobar<br> <span class="subtitle">What's special about it?</span></h1>
        <p>Long fabled among travellers for its gorgeous beaches, underwater wonders and primeval location in the middle
            of nowhere, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are still the ideal place to get away from it all. The
            archipelago has around 572 islands of which only 36 are open to tourists. The island population is an
            interesting mix of south Indian and Southeast Asian settlers, as well as Negrito ethnic groups on some
            islands whose arrival here still has anthropologists baffled.</p>
